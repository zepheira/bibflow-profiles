BIBFLOW Profiles for Scribe
===========================

Developed in conjunction with UC Davis for the [BIBFLOW project](http://www.lib.ucdavis.edu/bibflow/), these profiles can be used with [BIBFRAME Scribe](https://github.com/zepheira/bibframe-scribe) to author data using the [BIBFRAME Vocabulary](http://bibfra.me).
